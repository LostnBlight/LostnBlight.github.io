**Let me start from the beginning..**

I have always been interested in technology. When I was 5 years old I played my first video game *Super Mario 64* on the Nintendo 64. This was also the day I instantly got addicted to video games, as I got older I started to ask questions like "How did they do that?" and "Would I be able to do something like this?". This is what I believe started me on this track to figure out what I wanted to do. As I got older playing different types of video games I kept asking those questions over and over again. I played on console when I first started playing video games but then I moved to pc and haven't moved since. Obviously my first thought was "I wanna become a professional gamer" but I knew that it takes way more time than I had to get extremely good at said video games. But being a pc gamer I loved how everthing was created wether it was websites or games I just wanted to know how they did it and what would I do if I were to build/make whatever game/website it was.

I wanna skip ahead to learning how much I actually loved working with code and Software Development. When I was in my teens I really wanted to work with computers so I did as much research as I could to see what I could do. Everything started when I found out about Graphic Designing. I decided to try it because I was decent with art and started buying books and watching videos on how to do Logos and reach out to businesses. I realized after a while of doing it I was getting very bored with it, I kept coming up with Ideas that I was never satisfied with in the end. I started to fall off Graphic Designing and coding languages were my next go to. It took me a while to finally put time into it but once I got that time I began coding.

I began my journey of coding after falling off Graphic Designing. I started to a lot of different research on coding languages. I did a lot of research on what languages would be needed to make a app, game and websites etcetera. I wanted to learn the languages that had to do with games and websites, which led me mostly to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. These languages were the first languages I heard of, I began on teaching myself HTML and CSS which was very difficult. I learned the very beginning of HTML and CSS just simple "Hello Worlds" I switched to Python. I learned the very beginnings of python which to this day I don't remember a lot of but do have a lot of notes to look over if I needed. I immediately realized that I loved coding, yes it does get very frustrating. The reason I loved coding so much was because I was constantly thinking, constantly problem solving which is what I loved so much and when you see the end results and it works is such a... successful feeling. When you make your first "Hello World" after hours of trying and watching videos it feels so good to visually see your creation, I loved that feeling and had so many ideas that I wanted to make! The feeling of creating something that you truly feel successful and proud of what you did, is the reason I wanted to move foward with Software Development because I knew It was something I would enjoy a lot of and so excited to see where this journey takes me!
